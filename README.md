# 'The Game' Simulated
â†’ *This repository is currently still in the creation phase!*

This is a simple simulation of the popular card game ['The Game'](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(Kartenspiel)), where players iteratively have to put all cards from 1 to 99 onto two increasing and two decreasing stacks.
The only possiblity to decrease/ increase the stack is to place a card exactly ten lower or ten higher to the current top card.
